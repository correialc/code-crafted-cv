# Code-crafted CV

![latex](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-LaTeX-green)

Yes, my CV has a source code and it is here (thanks to `LaTeX`).

Having my CV in code makes it easy to manage different versions and keep track of the changes along the way. It is also a good strategy to identify and fix possible issues, so feel free to report any problem.

### CV Versions

Currently, there are 2 versions available:
- Data Engineer in English: `data_engineer_en_us.tex`
- Data Engineer in Portuguese (my native language): `data_engineer_pt_br.tex`

### What comes next...

I'm working on a CV for my academic experiences as a university professor.
